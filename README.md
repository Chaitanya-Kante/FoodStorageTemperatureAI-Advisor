# FoodStorageTemperatureAI-Advisor
Arduino + Python system for DHT11 temperature sensing, food detection, and TTS advice.
This repository contains two main components:

1. **Arduino Sketch** â€“ Reads ambient temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor and sends readings over serial.  
2. **Python Script** â€“ Captures an image via webcam, reads temperature from Arduino, uses OpenAI to detect food type, and provides voice feedback on whether the temperature is ideal for that food.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Real-time Temperature Sensing**  
  - Uses DHT11 to measure ambient temperature (Â°C).  
- **Computer Vision & Food Recognition**  
  - Captures and resizes webcam images.  
  - Encodes images to Base64 and queries OpenAIâ€™s vision model to detect food.  
- **AI-Driven Storage Advice**  
  - Asks OpenAI whether the measured temperature is ideal for the detected food and requests shelf-life information.  
- **Voice Feedback**  
  - Reads out results (detected food, ideal-temperature advice, shelf life) via TTS using `edge_tts`.

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Uno** (or compatible board)  
- **DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor**  
- 10 kÎ© resistor (pull-up)  
- Femaleâ€“male jumper wires  
- USB Aâ€“B cable  
- Breadboard (optional)

### Wiring

| DHT11 Pin | Arduino Pin | Notes                            |
| :-------: | :---------: | :------------------------------: |
| VCC       | 5 V         | Power                            |
| GND       | GND         | Ground                           |
| DATA      | D2          | Digital I/O (with 10 kÎ© pull-up) |

1. Mount DHT11 on breadboard.  
2. Wire VCC â†’ 5 V, GND â†’ GND.  
3. DATA â†’ D2, and add 10 kÎ© resistor between DATA and VCC.
